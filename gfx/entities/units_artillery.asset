#			Artillery uses three parts: 
#				A frame consisting of an empty scene with 3 joints,
#				2 of which are called "infantry" and "artillery".
#				An artillery gun which is the same for all nationalities.
#				A regular infantry unit.
#				
#			The artillery gun and infantry unit attaches to the different joints on the frame (artillery and infantry) and it will use
#			a certain infantry unit depending on what country specific artillery entity it is attached to.
