#	Triggers to control if diplomatic actions are enabled:
#		Format:
#
#		<diplomatic action tag>_enabled_trigger = {
#			<trigger contents>
#		}
#
#		ROOT is the country initiating the diplomatic action.
#		FROM is the recipient or target of the diplomatic action.
#
#		Note:  For cleaner tooltips, it is recommended that you use
#			if triggers within the enable triggers, and a single
#			custom_trigger_tooltip trigger within each if trigger.
#
#		Example: (Germany is prevented from declaring war on the Soviet Union.)
#
#		DIPLOMACY_WAR_ENABLE_TRIGGER = {
#			if = {
#				limit = {
#					tag = GER
#				}
#				custom_trigger_tooltip = {
#					tooltip = PREVENT_GER_WAR_ON_SOV
#					FROM = {
#						NOT = {
#							tag = SOV
#						}
#					}
#				}
#			}
#		}
