 ###Описания стран
 LUX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Outwardly, this small Duchy is unremarkable, but appearances are deceptive. The house of Luxembourg inherits Bohemia, and wins the struggle for her inheritance, and even become the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. However, you can go the other way - to develop a plan to divide France from within. It is risky, but who would refuse the chance to revive the Frankish Empire, because your land was its core."
 LIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Russia, Jamaicaa and other lands, in recent years expanded. This is just the beginning. Lithuania, potentially, can become the unifier of all Russia. The state can expand in any direction, because it is through your nation the Golden Horde could not pass."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Philip IV has already established himself as an experienced ruler, he always finds something to add to the budget. However, the nation has many problems. England owns part of our ancestral land, Aquitaine, and it seems that war is inevitable in the future. There is a good chance of defeating England - renewing the \"Old Alliance\" with Scotland. Also, it is very difficult to conquer Benelux. However, only you can change the situation!"
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Czech Kingdom, or Bohemia, is one of the strongest members of the Holy Roman Empire. In addition to its influential status in the Empire, Bohemia owns Silesia and Poland. Who knows, perhaps if you declare yourself a real Emperor, with the support of other princes, you can get the title of Emperor by force."
 KAZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the Golden Horde is weaker than its predecessor, the Mongol Empire, it keeps all of Russia in fear. However, there is a threat to you. Competitors in the South and East are not asleep. However, you still have a chance to restore the Mongol Empire under your banner."
 CHH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The yuan Empire, despite its seemingly stable state, is not going through the best years. In fact, the yuan is a dynasty of Mongol conquerors. According to the law of the heavenly mandate, they are considered the legitimate emperors of China. The nation will have to come out of isolation, recover from the Mongol invasion and decide whether to continue the affairs of the Mongol khans, or create the first Commercial Republic in the history of China."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Byzantium, once a great and powerful Empire, is now in a sad state. The people hate the Palaiologos dynasty, the Seljuk Turks are pressing from the East, and the northern nations are waiting for the best moment to attack. However, the country still has a chance of survival! Only you can decide whether to follow the path of the Roman Empire, or go back to the Greek origins."
