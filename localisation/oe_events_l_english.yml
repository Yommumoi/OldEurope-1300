 otkrytte.1.d:0 "The discovery of a new type of furnaces improved the quality of the metals produced. Also, in such furnaces, cast iron can be produced in large volumes. This technology originated in the state [FROM.GetName] and will gradually spread to neighboring states. \n (In addition to bonuses, smelters began to produce 4 more.)"
